===============

Hi there!

These bots just send latest hot submissions from subreddit **/r/%subreddit%** to telegram channel **@r_%subreddit%** hourly. For example [/r/gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/) â†’ [@r_gifs](https://telegram.me/r_gifs).

If you want to obtain your own channel for `/r/%subreddit%`:

1. Create new public telegram channel `@r_%subreddit%`.
2. Add `@reddit2telegram_bot` as administrator to this channel.
3. Make a pull request to this repo with new script to make posts (use `/channels/r_jokes/app.py` as draft).
4. Then I will make it alive :)
5. For any questions do not hesitate to contact me in [this group](https://telegram.me/r_channels) or [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/fillll).
